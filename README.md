# Google-Calendar-Scheduler
A series of google scritps that from a google sheets, allow a student to distribute automatically study time, task time and project time in the most efficient manner

The codes should be copy and pasted into a google scripts project linked to the google sheets corresponding to the example, any modifications to the excel will probably break the code so do so at your own discretion

Right now, the only interaction it has with the excel is to extract the tasks to use for the google calendar scheduler, but as i update the code a bit more, it should also show stats of grades, deadlines, etc, but for now this works

If you download the xlsx, the drawings i use to execute single functions might break, i need to see how to export a lossless google sheets but for now you just need to readjust size and add the function as a trigger
