# Google-Calendar-Scheduler
A series of google scritps that from an excel, allow a student to distribute automatically study time, task time and project time in the most efficient manner

The codes should be copy and pasted into a google scripts project linked to the google sheets corresponding to the example, any modifications to the excel will probably break the code so do so at your own discretion
